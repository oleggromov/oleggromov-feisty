When I was a kid, I liked a few things. I enjoyed reading and even read with a flashlight under the blanket. My other poison was Lego kits, which I didnâ€™t have many, but enjoyed building things a lot. Then, I fell for computers. From playing games, through deleting Windows 3.11 and formatting the hard drive, to programming with Basic and on.

It seems that my mother made me love reading by slipping in books I would love. Most of the times I recall it worked, and I would spend hours with a book.
