No matter which field you work in, you either have a system to manage your time, projects and other activities, or just desperately struggle to finally get things in order and finish at least something the most important. I know that feeling.

In fact, I still sometimes get back to that state of mind and every time, not without some bending over backwards, I get out of it into the normal state.

As an engineer in the beginning of my career and a team lead ever since 2014 when I assumed this role at Yandex, I had been completely dumped with tasks and projects, small and large, personal and work-related. Until just recently, when I assembled a system that works for me personally and as an employee.

## Purpose and Mission

When I do something for myself, like this blog, I perfectly understand why. In fact, it always starts with some kind of “why?” for me. This allows to prioritize any given project against the rest of things I’m aiming for and form a higher-level plan or roadmap of what I want to achieve, or feel, or whatever else it is.

Before I saw the first results proving this high-level planning working and defining the rest, I was always very sceptical about making my day-to-day personal activities a subject to some masterplan. It just sounds dull a bit, right? Like you’re not a unique snowflake just floating around until your ideal spot finally finds you.

Frankly speaking, without having some sort of a roadmap for at least a year, it would be completely impossible to make something. Important things tend to take time and ultimately take quite a lot. Be it studying, or bulking up, or launching a content website, or starting your business, or becoming a digital nomad and moving to a tropical heaven, or… any of these is going to take quite some time! And since I want to be sure I’m not just rambling around from a project to project, I need some direction.

I bet this part of defining what it is you want to have or feel in general is a very personal, even intimate activity. Given that said, I won’t even try to guide you. Just take a piece of paper, occupy a quiet place and do it. In case you really don’t know how to start, I’d recommend watching the fantastic [Happiness by Design by Paul Dolan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9XUO-MOmaA) and maybe taking somebody like Jeff Bezos and his [Regret Minimization Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ) as an inspiration.

Ultimately, it’s up to you to have this kind of guidance from your masterplan or not. If you end up having something similar, make sure to review your plan every now and then so you can check the progress, if any, and update your ideas. I do that once in a few months and call it “No regrets, values and projects exercise”.

## Months: Medium Planning Level

Once I have got some direction to follow, I can start looking for things that inspire me, something I really want to make or achieve, something that fuels me. It is again a very intimate and individual process, I assume, and also the thing that is inevitably tied to your masterplan. Sometimes you can get into what you want from life by observing your passions, sometimes the way around.

But anyways, I’ve got a year or around that in front of me and I want to draft what I will be working for during those months. For example, I want to lose fat and gain muscle, finally launch a personal blog, and create an educational course about programming.

Any of those is inherently complex, relatively hard to achieve, and consists of many moving parts. So I don’t obsess over having ridiculously well-defined process as I would do if I was creating a website for somebody else or putting together a weight loss plan as a fitness coach. It’s a creative process. I know I’m going to make mistakes along the road, it definitely will take me some tries to come up with the right design of working diet, etc.

Now I can really roughly schedule these large projects to specific months. Some of the things can be worked on in parallel, like bulking up and building a website, some of them cannot. As usually, I would say multitasking is a bad idea because it’s hard and less satisfying in the end. What is better for you, to have only a working website you’re proud of or a half-working website you’re ashamed to show to anybody and half-built course that can’t help anyone too?

I usually leave a lot of buffer time around each of projects. Maybe it’s worth saying that having priorities in order is more important than the actual schedule you end up having.

So for me, it’s clear that losing weight and getting into a healthier state of body is way more important than having a working website. Hence I prioritize the first over the last. In this particular situation it’s more of starting with planning for losing weight earlier so I can accommodate that into my usual day rather than completing my “weight loss” plan entirely before I start with the website.

## Overcoming “It’s Hard To Start”

Certainly, it’s not an easy process. I personally struggle a lot with getting on track of doing things because I’m convinced that doing things in a wrong way isn’t even worth trying. I’d rather know first how to lose weight and then do it than just start doing something without proper preparation and with a huge possibility of just getting nowhere in the end.

Maybe you have a different approach that works for you. Then make sure to share it in comments [#link to the comments]!

What I usually do is I research the topic and make a plan. Research includes getting enough information to start and steer into the right direction as you go. Sometimes you can come across something particularly wonderfully laid out for you, as in one of Julian Shapiro’s guides, such as [Building Muscle](https://www.julian.com/guide/muscle/intro). These times it’s super easy to just read the thing through and start following the plan. Since Julian states it’s easy to assess your progress right after each workout, it’s enough.

Oftentimes, there’s no such a guide. Or you’re just facing a completely new endeavor that you have no clue about starting. Then just go and collect some information, ideally from the sources you find trustworthy, and do something. It’s crucial that you start doing something after you have a rough idea of what you have to do.

For me a project like that may be starting an internet business. I understand to a certain extent what I want and what my limits are, in terms of time I can spend on it or money I can invest. I also do know some mechanics of internet business, like how you attract visitors and track them converting into your customers but that’s it. So I just have to start in a situation like this.

Once I have my preparatory work done, I schedule regular activities. When I learn math, I know that it takes a lot of repetitions to settle the new knowledge and toolkit for solving problems in mind. Then I will have three 2-hour long sessions each week and schedule them for the next month.

I also extensively use reminders of different kind to help me. The ruling idea here is to decide what it is you’re doing upfront and creating an environment that induces you to actually perform these productive activities.

Apart from schedules and reminders, which is clearly a very basic thing, you will need focused high-quality time dedicated to your activities, possibly a quiet working space if you don’t have one already, and an appropriate state of mind. I usually work on important things in the morning when my mind is still clear and I am not yet overwhelmed with other everyday activities.


## Slicing Large Things Into Smaller Chunks

Depending on the type of thing you work for, it can be that you have to make some pre-defined steps or just dedicate high-quality time to some particular activity and prepare for doing so for some period of time.

For instance, for a web developer to implement a well-designed website using familiar technology it’s going to be relatively well defined steps. It can be a mix of both if you work on your course assignment and even though you have an idea of what you’re making, it still requires a lot of exploration.

It can be complete chaos as with this particular website. I essentially had been doing a few things for a few months at the same time.

- Defining the message I want to convey with my personal brand.
- Looking for a proper form for it, meaning informational architecture and design.
- Creating [Feisty.js](https://github.com/oleggromov/feisty), which is a tool I use to build my website.
- And putting everything together in code.

If you just thought it’s insane you’re right. Don’t do that when you have any other choice. For me it was a very much creative and self-exploratory process, which I guess I had to perform eventually.

The core idea is to slice the work you have to do into consumable small chunks and schedule working on them for the foreseeable future so you just technically have a chance of achieving your goal. I guess it only makes it easier to have well-defined small chunks to focus on on day-to-day basis but if there’s some steep learning curve in what you do, chances are you will be involved in a fair amount of Brownian motion in the process.

Just make sure to revise the objective once in a while and keep working!


## Environment, Dedication and Distractions

If I had to select a single part of this article and throw everything else away it would be this part for sure. Environment and the ease of doing everyday small steps toward your goals define a lot. Similarly to the peer pressure that during adolescence nudges us into listening to particular music and sometimes even dating specific people, your work environment will certainly push you either to success or failure.

For me, the most important parts of a productive environment is free time, enough attention dedicated to a given problem, good isolated from noise and other distractions work place. This is the bare minimum. Ideally, being in a good energetic mood may also very well shape the result, specifically for creative work such as writing or programming.

With having free time, everything is relatively clear. You need to invest some time into things you want to do, be it a dinner with your family or climbing Mount Everest. Maybe sometimes it’s hard to estimate how much time you will need but then just assume the longest. If you finish earlier then fine, you’ll get a chance to give yourself a grateful pat on the back and work on something else.

About attention and maybe dedication, it’s a bit less obvious. Turns out, and unfortunately I can’t back this claim with any studies just now, we have a very limited amount of attention. Similarly to your muscle having some particular capacity at a given day to lift heavy stuff, your mind also has limitations.

For me, it’s about 2 to 4 hours each morning when the mind is clear and I can do challenging things. I hope I can train to extend this time but I haven’t succeeded yet. Anyways, the point being, you may want to try dedicating your most productive hours during the day to the things you care about most.

I won’t recommend to expect having everything done just because you have enough time for it. For me this has never worked. I would just stumble upon some issue and that’s it. Later at best I would just proceed from where I stopped and at worst, just give up. So I conclude, it’s better to dedicate my highly productive precious time to activities I want to succeed in.

With the workplace it’s also totally up to you. Some people are insanely productive on the Time Square, maybe because it fires them up with the energy. The others, and I assume a large slice of creative professionals, require a quiet and well ventilated space, with natural sunlight, good coffee, a comfortable chair and a desk to work productively.

Your list of things may totally vary from what I list but just make sure you put  some conscious effort into shaping your workplace so it helps you rather than blocks.

The last but not least, you need to focus. It means ideally you would get into what’s called flow state of mind or similar. Trance music, the right time of the day, a challenging and interesting task, and many other things may help you with it. But also make sure to just get rid of any distractions such as notifications on your phone, family members calling you, children crawling around or anything else depending on your life circumstances.

Finally, the more you nudge your brain in the direction of the project you work on, the better. Reminders on the wall or your display, articles, writing, your computer being open with the text editor if you’re a writer or code editor for programmers… all of those can help you sit down and do a few steps towards your goals.

The reason for that, I guess, is that we’re still partially lizards that react to stimuli surrounding us. You see some food, you go get it. You see your laptop open, you go write. With both it works because of hormones our bodies produce. So to make this mechanics work for the things you do, make sure to do something that lights you up.

## Tools and Processes

In order to have all described working for you, it’s better to have appropriate tools. I don’t use many and won’t recommend obsessing with them. In the end, even a bunch of post-it notes stuck here and there can work if you have your priorities straight and a proper environment inducing productive activity. But we want certainty, so come tools.

The most important one for me is a Kanban board. I started using KanbanFlow after I watched [How I Plan My Week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9k0OhJkjQ0) by Simple Programmer. It has quite nice features such as collapsing columns and built-in Pomodoro timer but unfortunately it’s still very raw in terms of implementation, lacks mobile app and looks a bit clumsy. So I switched back to Trello, which I have (not) used since I read [about it on the Joel’s Blog](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2012/01/06/how-trello-is-different/) for the first time.

It can look fancy and overwhelming if you’re not familiar with the concept of organizing work in columns or you don’t have a proper system. For me, it first failed because of the first reason and later didn’t work because of the second. I’ll assume the mechanics are well-known and proceed with how to organize work using multiple boards of different cards.


### Weekly Board

To start with, I have a weekly board, the most used, useful and beloved one. It has columns for each day, as well as “Next week”, “Later”, and “PRIO”. The “Done” column wasn’t very much useful and I just started archiving the cards after completion.

Each day is filled up with a few stacking cards, supposedly from the most important to the least, that are marked according to their sizes. Sizes come from either me knowing what exactly I have to do or just dedicating some particular amount of time to a particular activity.

I use the following sizes.

- Chores - something that is less than half an hour
- 1 pomodoro - 25 minutes
- 2 pomodoros - 50 minutes
- 3 pomodoros - 1:20
- Projects - everything that’s either bigger or less defined.

A pomodoro timer is a very useful tool when you can stay focused. I don’t know why it works, and maybe it even does not and I just confuse the effects of my internal urge to do things with this slicing approach; nevertheless, it’s worth trying. It forces you into focusing for a specific period of time and basically make things happen.

You may try using a real pomodoro, which is a kitchen device, or an application. I tried and found no benefits over just a usual countdown timer on my phone.
 After working for a pomodoro or two, it’s better to have 5-10 minutes of rest. Drink water, stretch up, talk to a friend - whatever it is that makes your energized and focused again.

I started with having everything sliced into (supposedly) 25-minute long chunks but it didn’t work. Some usual for me activities such as programming or writing usually take significantly longer so it makes sense to work at least for an hour. Others can’t be sliced, like my blog project with a lot of chaotic movements, and the cards were just moving from day to day all together. I finally gave up and just combined them into a single one that has this “Project” label and started moving it as a whole.

Usually on Mondays I define what I will be doing this week. Quite often a lot of cards from the previous week just make it to the new one one; honestly, I couldn’t care less. As long as things are getting done I’m fine with either just having 2 things for the entire week or moving 18 out of 20 each week.

Depending on your productivity, it sounds feasible to do 5-10 pomodoros daily. I usually complete just a few cards every day and move the rest to next days or even weeks.

### Monthly Board

The monthly board is a mix of non-important reminders and higher level projects to me. For instance, I will have something like “buy car insurance” for September as well as “Make programming course draft” for October. I also store the “No regrets, values and projects exercise” here as a reminder to have this focused time and revise my priorities every month or two.

I tie up my weekly board to the monthly with the recurring “Unpile monthly” card which I just pick from “Later” every end of month. There’s also no clear workflow with the “Monthly”. Every time I feel like I need to plan for something relatively big, I just open this board and add a card. Similarly, when I am out of important projects, which in fact has never happened up until now, I would just open my Monthly and see what’s hanging there.

Monthly board doesn’t have any sizes associated with the cards and serves only as a reminder and a higher-level overview of what I have planned for. To be exact, things I rank the highest in my priorities are very philosophical and abstract and don’t belong to any board. I just keep them in written in different notebooks and sheets of paper and cherish these physical artefacts.


### Bookmarks and Ideas

Since boards and columns are a useful, convenient, and well working tool, I started using them to keep my bookmarks and different ideas as well. I categorize bookmarks into “Pile”, “Books”, “Courses”, etc. and try to keep some order there. Despite my efforts, the lack of order holds the line and makes it very interesting to go through the lists once in a while.

Similarly to the bookmarks, I keep my ideas for writing, projects, and any other things I want to be actively doing on the “Ideas” board.


## Why Bother?

It had long time ago become a contradiction to some extent to me, that on one hand you want to achieve something and involve in hard and long projects whereas on the other, it’s just that you want to follow the current, have fun in the process, and stay happy and cheered up as long as possible.

These are the two sides of the same coin. According to Paul Dolan and his studies of happiness [another link here!], which I find the most compelling and well-thought out of lots of happiness research I’ve come across, what defines your happiness is what you feel every day, like joy or apathy or whatever it is, and the sense of purpose that you get from worthwhile activities such as raising kids or fighting for better ecology policies.

Looks like you can’t just be satisfied with your life unless both things are accommodated for and covered with regular activities.

Organizing your personal and work activities has not much to do with what you feel every day, even though it can be really fulfilling to see things being finally done. Neither is it an ultimately satisfying endeavor similar to building up a family. What it is, is just a way of making things that you lay out yourself achievable.

For me, without a system like that nothing had ever worked. I would stay buried under the burden of having a hundred ideas with zero progress at any of them for months and years. Maybe you have never struggled with getting important things done or just had a natural tendency to properly organizing and prioritizing your ideas. Then please go ahead and share your experience in the comments!


## Recap

So what you might try doing to organize your personal and work-related projects is the following.

Get the bigger picture and answer the “why?”. This defines the direction you proceed with and makes the results you achieve very valuable.
Prepare and plan on a higher-level (months) and week-level. It’s helpful to to know what you do on everyday basis and weave the smaller steps into your masterplan.
Dedicate enough attention, which is your most productive hours, and time as well as prepare your environment for productive work. The more distractions you manage to avoid the easier it will be to sit down and do important things.
Find your tools. Be it Trello or some other Kanban board, a bunch of stickers on the wall, or a notepad, you need something that works for planning, re-organizing things, and also provides you with a good overview. Try using timers, reminders and calendars and whatever else is helpful.


## Closing

I use similar principles with some additions to organize my personal projects and chores and the ones related to work as well. Usually it works pretty well and sometimes I still fail with achieving something I planned for. When that happens I try to stay calm and just acknowledge and appreciate this fact.

It looks that sometimes a failure is just a reminder about what’s really important for you, but in disguise. Sometimes, on the contrary, it’s no more than lack of proper preparation or improper environment. For example, while traveling for a month with my family I could barely work on any personal projects because I didn’t have a good working place.

I guess in the end, we all have to be kind to ourselves because life isn’t predictable at all. If it was, it would be such a foolish thing to live! And hence there’s nothing really worth beating yourself up about not completing some arbitrary project on time.

Instead, we can just get back to the origins, which is the “why?”, and work it all the way through from that moment. I hope this idea and approach helps you too as it has helped me many times!
