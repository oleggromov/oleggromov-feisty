No matter which field you work in, you either have a system to manage your time, projects and other activities, or just desperately struggle to finally get things in order and finish at least something the most important. I know that feeling.

In fact, I still sometimes get back to that state of mind and every time, not without some bending over backwards, I get out of it into the normal state.
