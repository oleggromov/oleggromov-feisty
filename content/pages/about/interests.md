## Areas of Interest
The best application of my skills so far has been the area where software engineering, product mindset, and critical thinking overlap.

It’s usually about accumulating deep insights in some field and using them to tackle meaningful business challenges by building software, supporting engineers in doing their best, and communicating a lot.

Aside from those “softer” skills , I’m experienced in a few major things.

- **Design, development, and maintenance of web projects** through their entire life cycle, with the emphasis on full-stack JavaScript engineering.
- **Management of engineering teams** supporting critical, revenue-generating business domains, up to 12 people large, while still being deeply involved in defining architecture, technology stack and doing hands-on coding, as well as being responsible for people, product, and ultimately delivery on time.
- **Digital marketing** with the focus on conversion analysis and optimization and respect to user experience, application performance, and SEO.

In my free time, I enjoy studying advanced math, helping people understand technology, playing musical instruments, making film shots, and having fun with my family.
