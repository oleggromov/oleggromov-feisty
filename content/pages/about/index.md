Hi there,

Iâ€™m Oleg Gromov. I mostly write about my experience in software development, managing people, and education.

Since 2007, I have been involved into various software projects of different scale and worked for different organizations, small and large.

## Areas of Interest
The best application of my skills so far has been the area where software engineering, product mindset, and critical thinking overlap.

Turns out, itâ€™s usually about accumulating deep insights in some field and using them to tackle meaningful business challenges with software, supporting engineers in doing their best, and communicating a lot.

Aside from those â€˜softerâ€™ skills, Iâ€™m experienced in front-end development, digital marketing, data science and statistics, and a bit of mathematical modeling.

In my free time, I enjoy studying advanced math, helping people understand technology, and taking care of my family.
