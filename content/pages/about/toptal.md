**Head of the Public Pages** team at [Toptal](https://toptal.com), the remote talent network company.

I mostly focus on making my team happy and productive, empowering us to meet business objectives and expectations, and contributing to the modern front-end technology.

Up till August 2018, as a developer, I created a performance monitoring tool for our website with great parallelization capabilities. It works on top of the Google Cloud infrastructure and uses Lighthouse and Docker. Also, I crafted new and updated existing marketing pages.
