I’ve recently joined a developer community Dev.to. It is a really nice place where people spur discussions and ask questions that are not only related to technologies and software development but are incredibly important as well, for us as human beings constantly looking for meaning in life. One of these questions is moving: “What are your career goals?”

I’ve spent a decent hour writing and polishing the answer and it turns out to be so important and concise that I’d like to publish it on my own website. Publish in order not to lose it, share it with people who’re interested in me and emphasize this incredibly important reasoning I’ve happily derived from my latest experience. I hope my thoughts might be even helpful for those who constantly question their careers and even themselves.
