There is a widely held notion, and I agree, that declarative code is better than imperative. It is less error-prone, usually much more eloquent and neat and thus much more maintainable. It is a good principle to follow on a day-to-day basis when you use existing declarative libraries like the JavaScript standard library (`Array`/`Object` methods etc.), underscore/lodash or React. However, when it comes to making a decision to either write some declarative code (and therefore much more generalized) or just leave an imperative ad hoc solution, I suggest thinking at least twice.
