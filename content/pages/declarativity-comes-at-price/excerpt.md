There is a widely held opinion, which I usually support, that declarative code is "better" than imperative. It is less error-prone, usually much more eloquent and neat, and hence more maintainable. It is a good principle to follow on a day-to-day basis when you use existing declarative tools or libraries, like JS standard `Array` methods, or `lodash`, or React.

However, when it comes to deciding to either write some declarative, and therefore more generalized code, or just leave an imperative solution, I suggest thinking at least twice.
